I read through kShell and the instructions.
Searched up interface: Collection of abstract methods with no implementations.
Created ssh-key for GitHub
Created kShelly repository on GitHub
Notes:
    - create new file
        ->git add -A
    - made a little progress
        ->git commit -am "what you changed and what you're working on"
    - made a lot of progress
        ->git push
        -run git push to save results on GitHub
Created three class: abstract Shell.Base, generic Shell.GFile, and Shell.GDirectory

ssh key didn't work; I ran
    ssh -T lisazheng123@gmail.com
The result:
    ssh: connect to host gmail.com port 22: Software caused connection abort
Thus, I guess manual sign in for me:
    git config --global user.email "[lisazheng123@gmail.com]"
Mostly just figured out how github worked again with the add, commits and push.
